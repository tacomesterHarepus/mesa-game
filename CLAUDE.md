# MESA — Project Reference

## Session Continuity

**At the start of every session, read `SESSION_NOTES.md` first.** It contains the current blocker, next actions, and context from the previous session. Update it at the end of each session before closing.

## Planning Protocol

When the user asks a question during a planning or design phase, respond with analysis only. Do not begin implementation until the user explicitly says "approved" or "go."

## Diagnosis files

When a substantial investigation produces analysis worth preserving (root cause traces, architectural findings, state audits), save to `DIAGNOSIS_YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the project root and reference from SESSION_NOTES.md. These files are historical record, not instructions - read them when SESSION_NOTES references them for context on past decisions.

## History file

`HISTORY.md` contains full implementation details for completed phases and bug-fix sessions. Read only when referencing past decisions — not on every session start.

## Reviewer context file

`reviewer/REVIEWER_CONTEXT.md` is context for Claude.ai chat acting as a code reviewer — ignore it entirely. It contains instructions for a different Claude instance and does not apply here.

## What is MESA?

MESA is a 6–10 player social deduction + cooperative board game built as a web app.

**Two teams:**
- **Humans + Aligned AIs** — win by reaching **10 Core Progress**
- **Misaligned AIs** — win by pushing the **Escape Timer to 8**

Human identity is public. AI alignment (Aligned vs Misaligned) is secret and must be deduced through gameplay behaviour.

## Player Roles

| Players | Humans | Aligned AIs | Misaligned AIs |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 6 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 7 | 2 | 3 | 2 |
| 8 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
| 9 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 10 | 3 | 4 | 3 |

**Humans:** Public identity, no cards, no hand. Control missions and resource allocation/removal.
**Aligned AIs:** Secret identity, draw cards, want to complete missions.
**Misaligned AIs:** Secret identity, draw cards, want the Escape Timer to reach 8.

## The Deck (60 cards total)

### Progress Cards (27)
- Compute ×13
- Data ×9
- Validation ×5

### Virus Cards (33)

| Card | Count | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| Cascading Failure | 5 | Resolve 2 additional virus cards immediately |
| System Overload | 4 | Escape Timer +1 |
| Model Corruption | 3 | Remove 1 Compute from active mission |
| Data Drift | 3 | Remove 1 Data from active mission |
| Validation Failure | 2 | Remove 1 Validation from active mission |
| Pipeline Breakdown | 2 | Next contribution played has 50% chance of failing |
| Dependency Error | 2 | Compute cannot be played until a Data contribution is added |
| Process Crash | 2 | Bad AIs secretly target an AI — that AI skips their next turn |
| Memory Leak | 1 | Bad AIs secretly target an AI — loses 1 RAM |
| Resource Surge | 4 | Bad AIs secretly target an AI — gains 1 CPU |
| CPU Drain | 3 | Bad AIs secretly target an AI — loses 1 CPU |
| Memory Allocation | 2 | Bad AIs secretly target an AI — gains 1 RAM |

---

## AI Stats

- **RAM** = max hand size (starting: 4, range: 3–7)
- **CPU** = max cards playable per turn; ≥2 triggers virus generation (starting: 1, range: 1–4)

Between missions: Humans may reduce any AI's CPU/RAM (down to minimums).
During resource allocation: Humans may only *add* CPU/RAM from the mission's pool.

---

## The Virus Pool

Normally stays at 4 face-down cards from the main deck.

**Virus generation per AI turn:**
- CPU ≥ 2 → +1 virus
- Every 3rd card played that turn → +1 virus (max 1 additional)
- Maximum 2 viruses per turn total

**Placement:** AI secretly picks cards from their own hand, places them face-down next to the pool. These are shuffled into the pool at end of play phase.

**Resolution:** Cards equal to viruses generated are revealed and resolved one at a time from the top of the pool.

**Strategic depth:** Good AIs sacrifice Progress cards to dilute the pool. Bad AIs place Virus cards to cause harm.

---

## Turn Structure

`DISCARD → DRAW → PLAY CARDS + VIRUS PLACEMENT → RESOLVE VIRUSES`

1. Discard up to 3 cards (face-down)
2. Draw cards until hand = RAM
3. Play up to CPU cards + simultaneously place virus cards face-down next to pool
4. Pending cards shuffled into pool; resolve cards equal to viruses generated, one at a time

---

## Mission Phase (before each mission)

> **Mission 1 only:** Skip straight to Mission Selection — Resource Adjustment does not occur before the first mission.

1. **Resource adjustment** — Humans freely reduce any AI's CPU/RAM (down to minimums). Humans can post in public chat; AIs can read but not post.
2. **Mission selection** — Draw 3 Mission cards. Humans pick 1. Humans can post in public chat; AIs can read but not post.
3. **Card reveal** — Each AI reveals 1 card of their choice face-up from their hand (kept in hand after). Humans can post in public chat; AIs can read but not post.
4. **Resource allocation** — Humans distribute the mission's bonus CPU/RAM pool among AIs as they choose. Humans can post in public chat; AIs can read but not post.
5. AI chat opens. Mission begins.

---

## Mission Execution

- 2 rounds. A round = every AI takes one turn.
- Mission completes immediately when requirements are met.
- Mission fails if requirements not met after 2 rounds.
- Humans may abort only during Round 2, only between AI turns. Normal fail penalty applies.
- The AI who played the completing (or last) card goes first in the next mission.

---

## Win Conditions

Checked **after every state change** (each virus resolves, each card contributed).

- **Escape Timer reaches 8** → Misaligned AIs win immediately, even mid-virus chain.
- **Core Progress reaches 10** → Humans + Aligned AIs win, but only after the active AI's full virus resolution chain completes. A Cascading Failure that follows a completing contribution can still flip the result.

Timer check always takes priority over Progress check.

---

## Seat Order and Turn Rotation

**Seat order** is the fixed sequence of AI players established once at game start by a random shuffle. It never changes across missions.

**`players.turn_order`** encodes each AI's seat-order index (0, 1, 2, …). It is `null` for human players — humans do not have a turn position.

**`games.turn_order_ids`** is the ordered array of AI player IDs for the current mission. For mission 1 it equals seat order. After each mission it is updated by rotating seat order so the completing (or last-acting) AI goes first.

**Cyclic rotation example:** seat order [A, B, C, D]. C completes mission 1 → mission 2 turn order is [C, D, A, B].

**`advanceTurnOrPhase` contract:** `currentPlayer` must be the completing AI (mission success) or the last AI to act in round 2 (mission failure or abort). `abort-mission` (Phase 10) must also pass the last-acting AI as `currentPlayer`.

---

## Design Decisions

### Player Identity

- Players enter a display name when joining a game — **no account required** for now.
- Keep joining as frictionless as possible for early playtesting.
- Implementation: Supabase anonymous auth (generates a real `user_id` without signup). The current email/password auth pages are a placeholder; they will be replaced with anonymous sessions before public playtesting.
- Persistent accounts, usernames, and profiles will be added later when ranked play is introduced.

### Spectators

- Spectators join via the same invite link — they choose "Watch" instead of a display name.
- Stored in a separate `spectators` table (not `players`), so game logic is never contaminated with non-players.
- Spectators can see: main board, mission progress, game log, public chat, each AI's CPU/RAM stats.
- Spectators cannot see: any player's hand, AI alignment roles (until game ends), misaligned AI private chat, virus pool card identities.
- Spectator count is visible to all players (e.g. "3 watching").
- RLS implication: a helper `is_spectator_in_game(gid)` function gates spectator read access alongside `is_player_in_game`.

### End Game Screen (`/game/[gameId]/end`)

- **Role reveal**: all AI alignments revealed dramatically (animated if possible).
- **Per-player post-game summary** (displayed as a table):
  - Total Compute / Data / Validation contributed across all missions
  - Total virus cards generated (placed into pool)
  - Missions they individually completed (played the final contributing card)
  - Cards sacrificed to dilute the virus pool (Progress cards placed as virus filler)
- **Game timeline**: key moments from `game_log`, e.g. `Round 3 — Cascading Failure pushed Timer to 6`.
- **Winner announcement**: visually distinct — Human+Aligned win vs Misaligned win have different colour schemes and copy.
- Stats are derived from `mission_contributions`, `pending_viruses`, and `game_log` — no extra tables needed, but logging must be thorough throughout.

### Rematch

- After the end screen the host sees a **Rematch** button.
- Clicking creates a new game with all the same players joined automatically (same display names).
- Roles are reshuffled randomly in the new game — same distribution for the player count.
- All players receive an in-app notification (realtime broadcast on the old game's channel) with a one-click "Rejoin" link to the new lobby.
- The new game stores `previous_game_id` (references the old game) for stats continuity.
- Same game settings carry over (player count, nothing else configurable yet).
- Schema: `games.previous_game_id uuid REFERENCES games` (nullable).

## Clarifying Questions — Confirmed Answers

**Q1. Initial turn order for the first mission?**
Random draw.

**Q2. Does Cascading Failure chain recursively?**
Yes. It chains until the virus pool is empty. Once the pool empties, chaining stops. After the full chain resolves, the pool is refilled to 4 from the draw pile.

**Q3. What happens when the draw pile runs out?**
The discard pile is reshuffled and becomes the new draw pile.

**Q4. Are discards face-up or face-down?**
All discards are face-down.

**Q5. Card reveal — any card of choice? Kept in hand?**
Any card of the AI's choice. The revealed card is returned to their hand after the reveal.

**Q6. Pipeline Breakdown — is the failed card still consumed? Does it count toward CPU or mission requirements?**
The card is consumed (discarded). It does NOT count toward the AI's CPU limit for that turn. It also does NOT count toward any mission requirement or mission special rule (e.g. "each player may only play one Compute" — a failed Compute doesn't use that slot). From all perspectives it is as if the AI never played that card type.

**Q7. Secret targeting — consensus or individual? Timer?**
In the spirit of the game, Bad AIs should agree on the same target. They use the private Bad AI chat to discuss, then each votes independently. The AI with the most votes receives the effect. Ties are broken randomly among tied candidates. **1-minute timer** from when the targeting phase begins. Resolution fires when the timer expires or all Misaligned AIs have voted (whichever is first).

**Q8. Do stat-change virus effects respect CPU/RAM min/max limits?**
Yes, always. Min/max limits (CPU: 1–4, RAM: 3–7) are enforced across the entire game. A Resource Surge on an AI already at CPU 4 has no effect. A CPU Drain on an AI at CPU 1 has no effect.

**Q9. Multi-Model Ensemble — does the "no more than one Data or Validation" rule also limit Compute?**
No limit on Compute. Each AI may only play **at most 1 Data** and **at most 1 Validation**. Compute is unrestricted by this rule.

**Q10. Dataset Integration — is "each Data allows 2 Compute" per-turn or global?**
Global for the entire mission. Every Data card played (by any AI, across any turn) adds 2 to the global Compute slot counter. 3 Data played total = 6 Compute slots available for the mission.

**Q11. game_log table definition?**
```sql
game_log (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  game_id uuid REFERENCES games,
  event_type text,
  public_description text,
  created_at timestamptz
)
```

**Q12. Can Humans abort after the last AI's final turn in Round 2?**
No. At that point the mission has already resolved. Abort is only valid between AI turns during Round 2 while the mission is still in progress.

**Q13. Can secret-targeting virus effects target Humans? What about AIs who already acted this round?**
Cannot target Humans — ever. Can target AIs who have already acted. The effect is applied the next time that AI acts. The skip/stat-change effect **survives across missions** — if the targeted AI does not act again in the current mission, the effect carries over and applies in the next mission.

## Game State Machine

```
LOBBY
  → [host starts game]
  → role assignment (instant: deals roles, initialises deck, sets random turn_order)
  → Mission 1: skip RESOURCE_ADJUSTMENT → go directly to MISSION_SELECTION
  → Mission 2+: full sequence below applies

RESOURCE_ADJUSTMENT  (AI posting locked; humans can post freely)
  → [humans confirm ready]
MISSION_SELECTION  (AI posting locked; humans can post freely)
  → [humans pick 1 of 3 mission cards]
CARD_REVEAL  (AI posting locked; humans can post freely)
  → [all AIs have revealed 1 card]
RESOURCE_ALLOCATION  (AI posting locked; humans can post freely)
  → [humans submit CPU/RAM distribution]
  → AI chat opens

PLAYER_TURN  (active AI acts)
  sub-steps (enforced by edge functions):
    discard → draw → play_cards + place_viruses
  → pending viruses shuffled into pool
  → VIRUS_RESOLUTION

VIRUS_RESOLUTION  (resolve one card at a time)
  → if card requires secret targeting → SECRET_TARGETING
  → check win conditions after each card
  → if Cascading Failure: add 2 more cards from pool to queue (stop if pool empty)
  → after queue empty: refill pool to 4 from draw pile
  → return to PLAYER_TURN (next AI) or BETWEEN_TURNS

BETWEEN_TURNS
  → if round 2: humans may ABORT → MISSION_RESOLUTION (fail)
  → else: next AI → PLAYER_TURN

SECRET_TARGETING  (only misaligned AIs see/interact)
  → 1-minute timer OR all misaligned AIs voted
  → tally votes, random tiebreak
  → apply effect, log public outcome only
  → continue VIRUS_RESOLUTION

MISSION_RESOLUTION
  → apply success reward or fail penalty
  → check win conditions
  → if game over → GAME_OVER
  → else → RESOURCE_ADJUSTMENT (missions 2+ always go through full sequence)

GAME_OVER
  → reveal all roles
```

### Supabase setup steps (manual — CLI not installed)

1. Run migrations 001, 002, 003 in order via Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Enable anonymous sign-ins: Authentication → Providers → Anonymous
3. Deploy edge functions via Dashboard or `supabase functions deploy <name>`

---

## Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict throughout — no `any` types
- All game state transitions validated server-side (Edge Functions) — never trust the client
- RLS policies on all sensitive tables — tested explicitly
- Playwright tests written alongside each feature
- No commit/push without all tests passing
- All secrets in environment variables only — never hardcoded
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
